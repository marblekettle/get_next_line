get_next_line
An exercise in text files and static variables

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.

Completed goals:
- Function get_next_line reads one line from a file descriptor and returns it.
- Arbitrary nonzero, non INT_MAX++ buffer size
- Free of memory leaks
- Can read from stdin/redirection
- Compact static variables into one
- Allow for more file descriptors to be used simultaneously.

Completed on 10-12-2019 with a 107/115 score.
